      <p>Aside from research, I also love to write! I am passionate about science communication, particularly data and numerical literacy. Here are some of my published articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://covidtracking.com/blog/confirmed-and-probable-covid-19-deaths-counted-two-ways"><em>Confirmed and Probable COVID-19 Deaths, Counted Two Ways</em></a><br>
<strong>Quang P. Nguyen</strong> and Kara W. Schechtman<br>
<em>The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic</em><br>
We&rsquo;re up to 24 states publishing both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, and we&rsquo;re adding those data points into our API. But states are also using two different ways of deciding which deaths to count as COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p><a href="https://covidtracking.com/blog/what-is-a-probable-case-of-covid-19"><em>What Is a Probable Case of COVID-19?</em></a><br>
Erin Kissane and <strong>Quang P. Nguyen</strong><br>
<em>The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic</em> <br>
Probable cases of COVID-19 make up only a small fraction of currently reported cases, but the CDC wants states to do a better job reporting them. So what are they and why do they matter? We took a closer look to help reporters and members of the public better understand this complex COVID-19 metric.</p>
<p><a href="https://covidtracking.com/blog/antibody-data-reporting"><em>Position Statement on Antibody Data Reporting</em></a><br>
Erin Kissane and <strong>Quang P. Nguyen</strong><br>
<em>The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic</em> <br>
As antibody tests become more widely available across the United States, we call on all states and territories to preserve the integrity and usefulness of their COVID-19 testing data by maintaining separate viral testing and antibody testing counts.</p>
