      <description>The elo rating system is a method developed by Arpad Elo as a way to rank players in a zero sum game. Elo has been used in various contexts, particularly notable in chess and more recently, competitive online games. A really nice attribute about Elo is that a difference in scores can be translated to a probability, through the formula:
$$E_A = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{R_A - R_B}}$$
where EA is the expected score of player A with rank $$R_A$$ playing against player $$B$$ of rank $$R_B$$</description>

      <description>This is my personal blog! I have decided to attach this to my website since I donâ€™t intend to blog too much outside of some side projects that I have or some random thoughts. I most likely blog about statistics and data science in general! Stay tuned for some pieces.</description>
