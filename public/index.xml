      <description>Research topics My research primarily concerns the statistical and bioinformatic analysis of infant gut microbiomes. Some overarching questions include:
 How to define functional redundancy in the context of complex microbial communities. How to leverage external information to perform hypothesis aggregation and variable selection for inferential/predictive tasks relating to microbiome research Multi-omics analysis of the microbiome.  Pre-prints and published manuscripts Multi-omic Characterization of the Taxa-function Relationship in Infant Gut Microbiomes</description>

      <description>Eddy Covariance Exploration Shiny App
[Source Code] [Shinyapps.io]
BIOL 16 is a course that examines fundamental concepts in the rapidly developing areas of ecology. As an part of the DIFUSE program funded by NSF at Dartmouth College, we built an interactive data visualization and analysis tool based on R Shiny for students to explore the eddy covariance technique. Students are able to view data in raw format, interact with different visualizations, as well as being able to use such data to learn about how carbon exchange differs between seasons and time of day.</description>

      <description>Aside from research, I also love to write! I am passionate about science communication, particularly data and numerical literacy. Here are some of my published articles:
Confirmed and Probable COVID-19 Deaths, Counted Two Ways
Quang P. Nguyen and Kara W. Schechtman
The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic
We&amp;rsquo;re up to 24 states publishing both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, and we&amp;rsquo;re adding those data points into our API. But states are also using two different ways of deciding which deaths to count as COVID-19 deaths.</description>
