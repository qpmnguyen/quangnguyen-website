<p><strong>Forecasting presidential elections using Elo rankings</strong><br />

In this semi-serious project, I explore Elo rankings and their probabilistic interpretations as a way to predict Presidential Elections. Specifically, I use each weekly poll as a “game” that each candidate can gain or lose elo. Elo gains and losses are scaled to the margin of victory, and priors from the 2016 election are added. An interactive Pluto.jl notebook is provided (set up will take very long unfortunately).</p>
