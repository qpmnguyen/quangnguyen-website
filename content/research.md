### Research topics  
My research primarily concerns the statistical and bioinformatic analysis of infant gut microbiomes. Some overarching questions include:  
* How to define functional redundancy in the context of complex microbial communities.
* How to leverage external information to perform hypothesis aggregation and variable selection for inferential/predictive tasks relating to microbiome research 
* Multi-omics analysis of the microbiome.

**Abstract:** The infant intestinal microbiome plays an important role in metabolism and immune development with impacts on lifelong health. The linkage between the taxonomic composition of the microbiome and its metabolic phenotype is undefined and complicated by redundancies in the taxon-function relationships within microbial communities. To inform a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and health, we performed an integrative statistical and machine learning-based analysis of microbe taxonomic structure and metabolic function in order to characterize the taxa-function relationship in early life.
