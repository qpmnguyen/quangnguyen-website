My name is Quang Nguyen and I am currently a graduate student in the Quantitative Biomedical Science program at Dartmouth College.  

I am a computational biologist, focusing on developing statistical and bioinformatic tools to investigate features of the infant gut microbiome, and how it relates to early life exposures and health outcomes. 

Check out my blog [Limit Testing](https://limit-testing.netlify.app) where I write about statistics and other fun things! You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/qpmnguyen), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qpmnguyen/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quangpmnguyen).
