Aside from research, I also love to write! I am passionate about science communication, particularly data and numerical literacy. Here are some of my published articles:  

[*Confirmed and Probable COVID-19 Deaths, Counted Two Ways*](https://covidtracking.com/blog/confirmed-and-probable-covid-19-deaths-counted-two-ways)  
**Quang P. Nguyen** and Kara W. Schechtman  
*The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic*  
We're up to 24 states publishing both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths, and we're adding those data points into our API. But states are also using two different ways of deciding which deaths to count as COVID-19 deaths.  

[*What Is a Probable Case of COVID-19?*](https://covidtracking.com/blog/what-is-a-probable-case-of-covid-19)  
Erin Kissane and **Quang P. Nguyen**   
*The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic*    
Probable cases of COVID-19 make up only a small fraction of currently reported cases, but the CDC wants states to do a better job reporting them. So what are they and why do they matter? We took a closer look to help reporters and members of the public better understand this complex COVID-19 metric.    

[*Position Statement on Antibody Data Reporting*](https://covidtracking.com/blog/antibody-data-reporting)  
Erin Kissane and **Quang P. Nguyen**  
*The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic*    
As antibody tests become more widely available across the United States, we call on all states and territories to preserve the integrity and usefulness of their COVID-19 testing data by maintaining separate viral testing and antibody testing counts.
