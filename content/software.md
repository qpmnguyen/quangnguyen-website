**Eddy Covariance Exploration Shiny App**  
[[Source Code](https://github.com/qpmnguyen/DIFUSE_2020_EddyCovariance)] [[Shinyapps.io](https://qpmnguyen.shinyapps.io/difuse_2020_eddycovariance/)]   
BIOL 16 is a course that examines fundamental concepts in the rapidly developing areas of ecology. As an part of the DIFUSE program funded by NSF at Dartmouth College, we built an interactive data visualization and analysis tool based on R Shiny for students to explore the eddy covariance technique. Students are able to view data in raw format, interact with different visualizations, as well as being able to use such data to learn about how carbon exchange differs between seasons and time of day.  
 

**`microbesim`: An R package for quick simulation of microbiome count data**  
[[Source Code](https://github.com/qpmnguyen/microbesim)]  
In order to develop and apply data analysis techniques to microbiome relative abundance data, researchers often have to perform numerical simulations that approximate real data. This R package was developed in order to collect together all the common ways to simulate microbiome relative abundance data and provide a uniform interface for quick-and-dirty simulations. *Currently under development*
